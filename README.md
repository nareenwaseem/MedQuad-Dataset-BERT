# MedQuad-Dataset-BERT

The MedQuad dataset is a rich resource containing over 43,000 medical questions and expert answers across 31 categories, facilitating advanced natural language processing research. This dataset includes responses from various healthcare professionals, allowing for nuanced exploration of correlations between treatments, chronic diseases, and medical protocols. Researchers can leverage this dataset to train transformer-based models like BERT for question answering tasks, optimizing hyperparameters such as encoder layers and dropout rates (e.g., 0.3 or 0.7). Evaluation metrics like BLEU Score and Rouge will be calculated, with results recorded using wandb for visualization and analysis, enhancing understanding and applications in healthcare decision-making and educational content development.
